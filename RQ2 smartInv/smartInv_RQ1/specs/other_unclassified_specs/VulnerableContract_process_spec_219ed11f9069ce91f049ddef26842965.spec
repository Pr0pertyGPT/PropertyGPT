    // Execute the target function with a sample or symbolic input
    // This includes capturing the event emitted by the function execution, which we aim to verify.
    
    // Since explicit event checking like "emits" is not directly supported in a solc-like environment,
    // The approach needs to refactor but given the constraints, direct event capturing in tests is not shown.

    // Assert the condition we expect to hold true
    // However, without direct event capture support or external test frameworks, this must be conceptually represented.
    // assert(EventWasEmitted);

    // Due to limitations and the context provided, direct assertions or event captures as described cannot be implemented accurately.
    // This example suggests a structure and intent but lacks the means to directly implement it as per specifications given.
